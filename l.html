    <p>Web hosting is a service that provides storage for the files that make up your website and the software, physical hardware, and network infrastructure that makes your website available to others on the internet.
        Web hosting service providers offer a variety of hosting options, ranging from expensive to inexpensive. The cost is essentially determined by the following:
        
        The amount of storage space and computing capacity allocated specifically for your site.
        
        The degree to which your site shares computing resources with other sites or is isolated from the impact of other sites sharing the same resources.
        
        The additional capabilities and services offered (e.g., number of email inboxes with your domain name, blogging capabilities, etc.).
        
        The degree of control and flexibility you have (e.g., which operating system (OS) and/or content management system (CMS) you can use, support for special web applications, etc.).
        
        The extent to which you manage your web site or have the service provider manage it for you.</p>
